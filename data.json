"Stock up with food and water there are some areas where it is over a 100 miles before the next source of food or water.",

"Take the map and guide book with a bit of skepticism and prepare for the worst. Towns might be closed (Atlantic City and Pie Town were both closed down for us), important creeks for water might be dry, and you will be climbing a lot, even if it doesnt say it.",
"The roads in New Mexico are the most primitive and washboarded of the whole route. Use caution. We rode on fully rigid rigs and were wished we had front suspension or a thud buster seatpost most of the rideâ€¦ especially in New Mexico. A 29+ bike may be ideal, although some sections the extra fat could definitely slow you down."
